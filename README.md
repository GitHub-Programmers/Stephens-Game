## A Tolkien lore game based on Stephen Colbert's famous Tolkien-offs.

Stephen Colbert (the famous host of The Late Show) is arguably the biggest Lord of The Rings nerd in the world. His knowledge in Middle-Earth lore is legendary and no one has ever matched him, until now. This game is based on Colbert’s famous Tolkien-offs and it is here to dethrone him by asking the most difficult Tolkien questions yet. Can you match his knowledge? Run the “Let’s Start!” file and find out.
 

## Getting Started
Open the "Let's start!.py" file using a text editor like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) and then run it so you can play the game.
